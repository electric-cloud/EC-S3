[[CreateBucket]]
=== CreateBucket

Creates an Amazon S3 bucket.

[NOTE]
====
A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. To ensure a single, consistent, naming approach for Amazon S3 buckets across regions, and to ensure bucket names conform to DNS naming conventions, bucket names must comply with the following requirements. Bucket names:

* Can contain lowercase letters, numbers, periods (`.`), and hyphens (`-`).
* Must start with a number or letter.
* Must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
* Must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, `192.168.5.4`).
* Must not contain underscores (`_`).
* Must not end with a hyphen (`-`).
* Cannot contain two, adjacent periods (`..`).
* Cannot contain dashes next to periods (for example, `my-.bucket.com` and `my.-bucket` are invalid).

=== WebsiteHosting

You can use Amazon S3 to host a website that uses client-side technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and does not require server-side technologies (such as PHP and ASP.NET). This is called a static website and is used to display content that does not change frequently.

To host your static website, use this procedure to configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting. It is then available at the region-specific website endpoint of the bucket: `<bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com`.

After the bucket is successfully configured for static website hosting, {PRODUCT} stores the bucket name as a key and Amazon S3 website endpoint for your bucket as a value in the property sheet. The default location is `*/myJob/S3Output`.

== Amazon Simple Storage Service plugin use cases

[[UseCase1]]
One of the common use case of this plugin is to host a publicly accessible website.To achieve this, create a bucket on Amazon S3 and then upload the contents to that folder.To do this, you must:

. <<setupconfig,Create a plugin configuration>>.
. Configure the <<CreateBucket>> procedure to create a bucket on Amazon S3.
+
.CreateBucket parameters
image::cloudbees-common-sda::cd-plugins/ec-s3/use-cases/case-1/createbucket-parameters.png[CreateBucket parameters,role="screenshot"]
. Configure the <<UploadFolder>> procedure to upload the contents of the folder to the bucket.
+
.UploadFolder parameters
image::cloudbees-common-sda::cd-plugins/ec-s3/use-cases/case-1/uploadfolder-parameters.png[UploadFolder parameters,role="screenshot"]
+
When this procedure runs, the contents of the `C:\Electric Cloud\electricCloud\Website` directory are uploaded to the `ecwebsitehosting` bucket.

. Use the <<WebsiteHosting>> procedure to configure the bucket for website hosting.
+
.WebsiteHosting parameters
image::cloudbees-common-sda::cd-plugins/ec-s3/use-cases/case-1/website-hosting-log.png[WebsiteHosting parameters,role="screenshot"]

. Run the procedures. The following output appears during the procedures:
+
.CreateBucket output
